//Code Sharing -
If you ever have to share code with others on social networks one solution is code blocks
But if code is too big to share you can use this as alternative, don't share files, as people will not download potential viruses

NoSQL Payloads:
https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20injecti
https://blog.websecurify.com/2014/08/hacking-nodejs-and-mongodb.htmlhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection
A common example of a NoSQL injection would be injecting something like:
[{"$gt":""}]. This JSON object is basically saying that the operator ($gt) is greater
than NULL (""). Since logically everything is greater than NULL, the JSON object
becomes a true statement, allowing us to bypass or inject into NoSQL queries. This
would be equivalent to [' or 1=1--] in the SQL injection world. In MongoDB, we can
use one of the following conditional operators:
(>) greater than - $gt
(<) less than - $lt
(>=) greater than equal to - $gte
(<= ) less than equal to - $lte

A bunch of articles are linked off here dealing with windows exploitation. I know Windows can become a weakness so it should be pretty useful to have on hand.  https://fullpwnops.com/windows-exploitation-pathway.html
A ton of notes on pentesting. https://book.hacktricks.xyz/
A bunch of code snippets to start some reverse shells. Usually, you can find at one that will work by trial and error. http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet
