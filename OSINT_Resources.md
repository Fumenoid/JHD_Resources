Make sure you have firefox installed, and try running it with sudo.

Also, make sure that you have the most recent version of the tool installed; https://github.com/sundowndev/PhoneInfoga

This is more OPSEC related, but
the "Three Conditions" are an essential thing to know and understand.
```
Condition White = You are not paying attention to your surroundings. Your face is in your phone or whatever. This can make you a target for potential threats and criminals.

Condition Yellow = Your situational awareness is fully active. You are seeing and paying attention to everyone and everything around you. OODA loops are essential here. This is the condition you want to always be operating in.

Condition Red = You are in danger. This is where your "fight or flight" insticts come into full affect. Fight for your life of get away from the threat, AKA; Get off the "X".
```

# 7oaster [OSINT Wizard]
These contitions all originate from the full set of Warrior Color Codes theorized by Jeff Cooper, in combination with the OODA Loop principle formulated by John Boyd.

Useful tool for Kik OSINT. It will return the obfuscated email address for users, even deleted accounts! Just note that a user can enter anything they like in their account email field however since Kik does not send a registration confirmation email. Tool is 4 years old, but it still appears to work great;
